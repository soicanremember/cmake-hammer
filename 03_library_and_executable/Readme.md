Simple library and an executable
===
The motivation of this layout is to provide a structure to accomodate:
1. A library that can possibly be used in other projects
2. An executable application that uses this library.

The layout is not the simplest that can be achieved, but it is extendable to allow for adding more libraries or apps.
